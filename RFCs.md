# RFCs

The Underlay maintains a RFC (Request for Comments) series to document our ideas, proposals, progress, and plans. RFCs represent snapshots of thinking and may contain outdated or deprecated ideas. Read Danny Hillis's [**RFC 0**]() for a more through description of the Underlay RFC series. Historical writings have been anachronistically mapped into this RFC series with negative numbering (e.g. RFC -2).
